### Abstract

In this project, we investigated whether spikes in
COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the United States
could be predicted from Google search data using
two supervised learning approaches: k-nearest neighbors and decision trees. The k-nearest neighbors model
outperformed the decision tree on this problem. Additionally, we examined whether regional and/or temporal trends in the data exist. We found that certain
symptoms were searched more frequently in certain
states, and within broader regions of the country. In
general, COVID-19 hospitalizations seem to have decreased over the summer months compared to March
and August, and are now rising again.
